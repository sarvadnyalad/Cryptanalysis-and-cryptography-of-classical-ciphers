Here are some additional enhancements you can consider:

Multi-Cipher Support: Allow users to apply multiple ciphers sequentially (e.g., Caesar followed by Vigenère).

User Authentication: Add a login/logout feature to restrict access to authorized users.

History Tracking: Display a history of previous encryption/decryption operations.

Export Results: Allow users to export the results as a file (e.g., .txt or .csv).

Input Validation: Add real-time validation for inputs (e.g., prevent non-numeric shift values or invalid Vigenère keys).

Key Storage: Allow users to save frequently used keys for the Vigenère cipher.

Dark Mode: Add a dark mode toggle for better accessibility and appearance.

Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure that the interface is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

Live Preview: Show a real-time preview of the encrypted/decrypted text as the user types.

Support for Other Ciphers: Implement additional classical ciphers (e.g., Affine, Atbash, or Playfair).

Brute Force Options: Provide a brute-force decryption option for the Caesar cipher.

Performance Metrics: Display performance metrics like processing time for each operation.

Clipboard Functionality: Add a button to copy results to the clipboard with a single click.

Tooltips and Help: Include tooltips or a help section explaining how each cipher works.

Theming Options: Allow users to select different themes for the interface.

Language Support: Support multiple languages for user input and output messages.

Secure Storage: Store encrypted messages securely on the server for retrieval later.

Visualization: Add graphical visualization of the encryption process for educational purposes.

Audio Feedback: Play a sound to indicate successful encryption/decryption operations.

Accessibility Enhancements: Improve accessibility for visually impaired users (e.g., ARIA labels).
